# Flutter User List App
In this project, I explored how to display basic information for an user such as First and Last name, their career and GPA.
One of the branches is the first ver which got data from a memory list.
Main branch explores how to consume and API, which has a response somewhat like this:
items: [{...:...,...:...}] a json lol.
